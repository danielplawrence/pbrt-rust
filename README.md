pbrt-rust is a Rust implementation of the physically-based renderer described in Pharr, Jakob and Humphreys (2004-2021), *Physically Based Rendering: From Theory To Implementation.* (https://pbr-book.org/)

This repo contains the implementation and step-by step implementation notes, including code samples which can be executed in the rust playground (https://play.rust-lang.org/).
