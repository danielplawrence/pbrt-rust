# pbrt-rust

pbrt-rust is a Rust implementation of the physically-based renderer described in Pharr, Jakob and Humphreys (2004-2021), *Physically Based Rendering: From Theory To Implementation.* (https://pbr-book.org/). This book details step-by step implementation notes for building the renderer in Rust. 

I am writing them primarily to aid my own understanding, but also in the hope that other Rust/3D rendering initiates might find them useful
